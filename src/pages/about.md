# The FinOps Engineer

> "Cloud bills are not just financial data; they are the scorecard of your engineering efficiency."

Hello, I’m **Animesh Anand**.

I am a **Senior Cloud Architect** and the Principal Consultant behind **14043723 Canada Inc.**, a specialized software consultancy focused on Cloud-Native Architecture, DevOps Automation, and FinOps Governance.

With **14+ years of experience**  across the UK and Canada, I have engineered critical infrastructure for major financial institutions including **Scotiabank**, **RBC**, **BMO**, and **Royal Mail Group**

## The Philosophy: Engineering Efficiency

My approach to software is simple: **Speed is the ultimate cost-saver.**

When you optimize for performance—reducing execution time, partitioning data correctly, and rightsizing compute—you don't just get a faster system; you get a cheaper bill. This intersection of **System Performance** and **Cost Optimization** is where I operate.

### Featured Case Study: The 98% Optimization
* **The Challenge:** A legacy data processing pipeline was struggling to handle thousands of parallel files, leading to bloated execution times and spiraling compute costs.
* **The Solution:** Architected an event-driven "Dispatcher" pattern on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.
    * **Orchestration:** Cloud Composer (Airflow) combined with Pub/Sub events to trigger functions dynamically.
    * **Compute:** Replaced heavy instances with ephemeral **Cloud Functions**.
    * **Data Engineering:** Implemented **DuckDB** and **Pandas** with intelligent hive partitioning to process data in-memory.
* **The Result:** Reduced report generation timeline by **98%**, turning an overnight batch process into a near-real-time event stream.

## Core Competencies

My consultancy offers specialized expertise in three pillars:

### 1. Cloud-Native Architecture & Migration
I specialize in "Lift and Shift" and modernization projects, moving legacy on-prem workloads to **AWS** and **GCP**.
* **Kubernetes (CKA):** Designing scalable clusters and Helm chart automation.
* **Serverless:** Migrating legacy code to event-driven functions (OpenFaaS, Lambda, Cloud Functions).
* **IaC:** Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation for reproducible infrastructure.

### 2. DevOps & Release Automation
Building the "paved road" for developer velocity.
* **CI/CD:** Architecting pipelines in Jenkins, GitLab, and Bamboo to reduce Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR).
* **Observability:** Integrating ELK, Prometheus, and Dynatrace for deep system visibility.
* **Python Platforms:** Managing complex JupyterHub environments for Data Science teams.

### 3. FinOps & Cost Optimization
Translating billing data into engineering action.
* **Resource Rightsizing:** Identifying underutilized resources and automating their decommissioning.
* **Spot Strategy:** Architecting fault-tolerant workloads to leverage Spot Instances.
* **FOCUS Compliance:** Mapping custom tags to the FinOps Open Cost & Usage Specification.

## Certifications
* **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** 
* **AWS Certified Developer** 
* **Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals** 

## Engagement Model
I am available for **B2B Contract Engagements** focusing on:
* Cloud Architecture Review
* FinOps Strategy Implementation
* DevOps Pipeline Optimization
