Cloud bills are no longer just a finance problem; they are an architectural bug.

As a Senior Software Engineer, I have watched the gap between *infrastructure code* (Terraform/Kubernetes) and *invoice data* (CUR/Billing Console) grow wider. Engineers provision resources with a keystroke, while finance teams struggle to map those resources to business value months later.

The industry standard answer has been "better tagging." But tagging is manual, error-prone, and often ignored.

I am launching **The FinOps Engineer** to explore a better way: **Engineering-led Cost Optimization.**

## The Mission: FOCUS First

This site will serve as a public technical lab. My primary focus for 2026 is the **FinOps Open Cost & Usage Specification (FOCUS) 1.0**.

The FOCUS project (backed by the FinOps Foundation) is attempting to normalize the chaotic billing schemas of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud into a single, queryable standard. If we can treat billing data like a standard SQL schema, we can build automated, proactive cost controls—not just reactive dashboards.

## What to Expect

Over the coming months, I will be documenting my journey toward the **FinOps Certified Practitioner (FOCP)** exam and publishing deep technical dives, including:

1.  **Schema Mapping:** Translating raw AWS Cost & Usage Reports (CUR) to FOCUS 1.0.
2.  **The Kubernetes Lab:** Running local cost allocation scenarios using Minikube and OpenCost.
3.  **Automated Governance:** Building guardrails that prevent waste before it deploys.

This is not a blog about "saving money." It is a documentation log about **efficient engineering**.

Hello, World.
