# The FOCUS Specification (v1.0)

## Why this matters
Cloud billing data is a mess. AWS calls it `lineItem/ResourceId`, Azure calls it `MeterId`. The **FOCUS** (FinOps Open Cost & Usage Specification) standardizes this into a single SQL-queryable schema.

## My Goal
I am documenting my path to the **FinOps Certified Practitioner** and **FOCUS Analyst** certifications. These are not management summaries; these are engineering field notes.

### Current Progress
- [ ] Domain 1: Cloud Billing Mechanics
- [ ] Domain 2: The FOCUS Schema
- [ ] Domain 3: SQL Query Patterns
